        Mars, often called the Red Planet, is the fourth planet from the Sun in our solar system. 
        It has captured human imagination for centuries and is a prime target for space exploration.
        
        The planet's reddish appearance is due to iron oxide (rust) on its surface. Mars has many 
        Earth-like features including polar ice caps, seasons, and a day length similar to Earth's.
